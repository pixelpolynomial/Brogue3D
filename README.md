# Brogue3D
A rewrite of Brogue into Godot faithfully reproducing vanilla Brogue in 3D.

It has been a number of years since Brogue 1.7.4 was released.
As an introduction to Godot and to preserve the experience of vanilla Brogue 1.7.4 in a modern open source engine Brogue 3D is designed to accomplish the objective goal of a completely faithful reproduction in a 3D engine to both assist those learning Godot and allow roguelike creators a new template to write their own roguelikes while using Brogue3D as a template.

All of the features in Vanilla Brogue 1.7.4 just in 3D.
